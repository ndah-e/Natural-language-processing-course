    "POS (Parts of Speech) tagging is the task of assigning grammatical classes to words in a natural language sentence based on both its definition and context. POS tagging can be handled either at word-level or sentence-level. At the word-level POS tagging is posed as a classification problem in which an appropriate tag for a word is found whereas at the sentence level a series of tags corresponding to the sequence of words are obtained. The intricacies in POS tagging arise from insufficient training data, inherent POS ambiguities and unknown words which are ubiquitous. POS tagging is an important step in many natural language processing applications such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, information extraction, machine translation, question answering, information retrieval etc. It is also the primary step in the syntactic analysis of a language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, there has been an increase in research on various techniques for “tagging”- assigning a part of speech (or “tag”) to each word in a text. For corpus rich languages like English, there have been many implementations of POS tagger, using machine learning techniques such as Second-Order Markov Models based tagger (Church, 1985) and (Kempe, 1993), Neural network based tagger (Schmid, 1994), Probabilistic Triclass Model-based tagger (Merialdo, 1994), Transformation Based Error-Driven Learning-based tagger (Eric, 1995), Maximum Entropy Markov Model-based tagger (Adwait, 1996), Memory-Based Learning-based tagger (Daelemans and Gillis, 1996), Markov Models based tagger with smoothing techniques and methods to handle unknown words (Brants, 2000).\n"

    "While most taggers return a single best tag for each word (single taggers). Some work has been done on taggers that return a list of possible tags in those cases where a second (or even third) best choice might be close to the best according to the tagger’s metric (multiple taggers). We might be tempted to ask if using a “multiple tagger”, improves parsing performance. First of all, research has shown that parsing accuracy, as measured by the correct assignment of parts of speech to words, does not significantly increase with multiple tagger. Besides, the work required to parse a sentence goes up with increasing tag ambiguity. Research has shown that single-tag taggers are quite adequate for most task.\n",

    "The N, V, A are the categories of the contentful or open-class vocabulary. A glance at any dictionary will tell you that most English words fall in one of these categories. Besides, these categories are open-ended (new words are often invented e.g. fax, biro) and often open-class words belong to more than one category and are thus ambiguous in terms of lexical syntax category (e.g. storm can be a noun or a verb and the morphologically related stormy is an adjective). Adverbs also form a large open-ended class, but they are highly related to adjectives and often formed by adding the suffix *+ly* to adjectives (badly, stormily, etc) so we would not give them a separate category but treat them as A[+Adv].\n",
    "\n",
    "The other categories are those of functional or closed-class words, which typically play a more ‘grammatical’ role with more abstract meaning. This class of words are fewer relative to the above and changes infrequently. For example, prepositions convey some meaning but often this meaning would be indicated by case endings or inflexion on words in other languages and sometimes there are English paraphrases which dispense with the preposition: “Kim gave a cat to Sandy”  or  “Kim gave Sandy a cat.” Degree intensifiers in adjectival or adverbial phrases very beautiful(ly) convey a meaning closely related to the comparative suffix more beautiful / taller. Determiners, such as the (in)definite articles (the, a), demonstrative pronouns (e.g. this, that) or quantifiers (e.g. some, all) help determine the reference of a noun (phrase) – quite frequently articles are absent or indicated morphologically in other languages (hence the common non-native speaker error of the form: “please, where is train station?”). \n",
    "\n",
    "The complete set of lexical syntactic categories in English depends on the syntactic theory, but the smallest sets contain around 20 categories and the largest thousands. Often words are ambiguous between different lexical categories. There are diagnostic rules for determining the category appropriate for a given word in context. For example if a word follows a determiner, it is a noun, e.g., “the song was a hit.” If a word precedes a noun, is not a determiner and modifies the noun’s meaning, it is an adjective e.g. “the smiling boy laughed.” These rules and categorical distinctions can be justified by doing distributional analysis both at the level of words in sentences. The following template schemata are enough to get you to the rules above, which are abstractions based on identifying the classes, like noun, determiner, and adjective  \n",

    "2. – older boy(s) can run \n",
    "3. The – boy(s) can run \n",
    "4. The older – can run  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways to make these distinctions too. For example, nouns often refer to fairly permanent properties of individuals or objects, boy, car, etc., verbs often denote transitory events or actions, smile, kiss, etc. However, there are many exceptions: storm, philosophy, weigh, believe, etc. Linguists have striven to keep syntax and semantics separate and justify syntactic categories on distributional grounds, but there are many interactions between meaning and syntactic behaviour. \n",
    "There are eight parts of speech (POS) in English: noun, verb, pronoun, preposition, adverb, conjunction, participle, and article. The POS are also called word classes, morphological classes, or lexical tags. They are important as they give a significant amount of information about the word and its neighbours. It is true for nouns and verbs. \n",

The Brown corpus consists of a million words of samples taken from 500 written texts in the United States in 1961. The WSJ corpus contains one million words published in the Wall Street Journal in 1989. The Switchboard corpus has twice as many words as Brown corpus.

For example, if the preceding word is an article, then the word in question must be a noun. This information is coded in the form of rules.\n",

In other words, the tag encountered most frequently in the training set with the word is the one assigned to an ambiguous instance of that word. But sometimes this approach comes up with sequences of tags for sentences that are not acceptable according to the grammar rules of a language. One such approach is to calculate the probabilities of various tag sequences that are possible for a sentence and assign the POS tags from the sequence with the highest probability. This is sometimes referred to as the n-gram approach, referring to the fact that the best tag for a given word is determined by the probability that it occurs with the n previous tags. This approach considers the tags for individual words based on context. The next level of complexity that can be introduced into a stochastic tagger uses both the tag sequence probabilities and word frequency measurements. This method uses HMM (Hidden Markov Model) algorithm. Based on this approach we pick up the most likely tag for the given word. \n",
